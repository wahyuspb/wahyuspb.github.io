#### **Me**

Hi, I'm Wahyu.

I hail from Central Java, Indonesia. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia where I completed a Bachelor of Informatics degree from The University of Amikom Yogyakarta.

I'm interested to know and learn how we can solve real world problems using technologies/frameworks/languages. I love to know more about enterpreunership, finance , sports and music.

#### **What I know**
As a result of my relentless curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python • SQL • NoSQL • Django • Git • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Spacy • Pandas • Numpy • OpenCV

for use with concepts such as:

Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering and <em>more</em>!

Right now, I prefer using Python for back-end, NLP and Deep Learning work.

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.

#### **Certificates I've completed:**

To feed my hunger for learning, I take online courses for different Data Science topics and work independently on projects in my free time. Some of them include:

* Machine Learning for Beginners - Dicoding Indonesia
* Mini Bootcamp Data Science - BISA AI Academy
* Deep Learning Sprint - DRLC Gadjah Mada University
* Data Scientis: Analytics Specialist - Codecademy
* Read <em>journals</em> to stay **updated** on algorithms and methods!

Check out my [portfolio](/projects) to see iPython notebooks and Github repos for some of the projects I've worked on.

And that's about it! Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahyuspb) or get in touch if you want to discuss opportunities, collaboration, consulting or have a heated debate about the best Tea in Indonesia. I'm always happy to chat!
